Language:
    Python

Back End:
    Django

Database:
    PostgreSQL

Front End:
    HTML
    CSS
    Bootstrap

Disadvantages:
    The architecture of our project 
    has been drawn assuming for a small and simple corporation.
    So if the user base gets larger then we'll face some issues, specially database related. As we've used PostgreSQL as our database, so for lots of
    SELECT queries the latency will increase, in that case we might consider other relational models. 
    Another disadvantage of the project is its manual workflow, for every complaint the admin himself/herself has to assign it
    to some employee, which we might think of changing if the userbase gets larger, intigrating Machine Learning model would be a good choice here.
